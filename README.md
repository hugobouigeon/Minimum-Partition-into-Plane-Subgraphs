# Minimum Partition into Plane Subgraphs (Feb. 2022)
Partitioning planar graphs such that edges do not intersect is an NP-hard problem. This implements an approximation for finding a minimal partition. This project was conducted in the scope of L'Ecole Polytechnique's 2nd year course on algorithmics.

## Performance:
Our programm runs in O(m^2) time, given a graph with m edges as input. Details on the proof of why this problem is NP-hard can be found in the project report. The report also provides insights on our algorithm and our results.
